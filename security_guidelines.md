# CTD Security Guidelines

## SWAT Checklist

Online you can find the [SWAT Checklist](https://www.sans.org/cloud-security/securing-web-application-technologies/) which is a checklist of best practices for application security.

Authentication
  29. Don't Hardcode Credentials
  30. Develop a Strong Password Reset System
  31. Implement a Strong Password Policy and Move Towards Passwordless Authentication
  32. Implement Account Lockout against Brute Force Attacks
  33. Don't Disclose Too Much Information in Error Messages
  34. Store Database Credentials and API keys Securely
  35. Applications and Middleware Should Run with Minimal Privileges

Session Management
  36. Ensure That Session Identifiers Are Sufficiently Random
  37. Regenerate Session Tokens
  38. Implement an Idle Session Timeout
  39. Implement an Absolute Session Timeout
  40. Destroy Sessions at Any Sign of Tampering
  41. Invalidate the Session after Logout
  42. Place a Logout Button on Every Page
  43. Use Secure Cookie Attributes (HttpOnly, Secure and SameSite Flags)
  44. Set the Cookie Domain and Path Correctly
  45. Set the Cookie Expiration Time

Input and Output Handling
  46. Conduct Contextual Output Encoding
  47. Prefer Allowlists over Blocklists
  48. Use Parameterized SQL Queries
  49. Use Tokens to Prevent Forged Requests
  50. Set the Encoding for Your Application
  51. Validate Uploaded Files
  52. Use the Nosniff Header for Uploaded Content
  53. Validate the Source of Input
  54. Use the X-Frame-Options Header
  55. Use Secure HTTP Response Headers
  56. Deserialize Untrusted Data with Proper Controls

Access Control
  57. Apply Access Controls Checks Consistently
  58. Apply the Principle of Least Privilege
  59. Don't Use Direct Object References for Access Control Checks
  60. Don't Use Unvalidated Forwards or Redirects

## OWASP Top 10

There is also an [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) list. 

<details><summary><code>OWASP Top 10, 2021</code></summary>

<br>
<pre>
1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures
3. Injection
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfiguration
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
7. Identification and Authentication Failures
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
10. Server-Side Request Forgery
</pre></details>

## CTD 30-Point Security Audit

Both lists reference [CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/index.html).
If you use the CWE IDs to find the intersection of these security weaknesses,
the result is the CTD 30-Point Security Audit.
